Application written for third year Social Networking course.

###Components
####Server
A simple API written in NodeJS to expose routes for the client application. Communicates with MySQL DB for persistence.

####Client
iOS application that allows users to create a user, login, post items for sale, and make offers on existing items.

####Webapp
A webapp that I originally worked on for the Hack the North hckathon that follows the same concept as the iOS/Server, however uses Facebook for auth and CouchDB for persistence.
